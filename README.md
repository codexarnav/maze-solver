This project is a Maze Solver implemented in Python using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It navigates through a maze to find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal. The solver reads a maze input in the form of a grid, where each cell represents open paths, walls, a start point, and an endpoint. The BFS algorithm ensures that the shortest possible path is found, if one exists, by exploring all neighboring nodes level by level.

Features:

Efficient maze traversal using the BFS algorithm.
Handles various maze configurations with different dimensions and complexities.
Visual representation of the maze and the solved path.
Simple and intuitive input format.
